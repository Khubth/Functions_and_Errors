# Functions_and_Errors
This Solidity contract demonstrates the usage of require, assert, and revert statements in Solidity. 
It also includes basic token management functionalities such as minting and burning tokens.

# Description
The RequireAssertRevertExample contract is a basic example of a token management system on the Ethereum blockchain. It showcases how to handle common scenarios such as ensuring only the owner can perform certain actions (require), checking contract invariants (assert), and deliberately reverting transactions (revert). The contract includes the following functionalities:

` Owner Management: Only the contract owner can mint and burn tokens.
` Token Minting: Create new tokens and assign them to an address.
` Token Burning: Destroy tokens from the owner's balance.
` Invariant Checking: Ensures that the total supply of tokens is always non-negative.
` Forced Revert: A function that always reverts for demonstration purposes.
